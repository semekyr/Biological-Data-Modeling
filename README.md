# Biological-Data-Modeling
## Overview:
This repository contains two labs, focusing on biological data analysis and modelling using Python. 
## Lab 1: Inferring Protein Concentration from RNA Data:
ðŸ“Œ **Objective**: Analyze and model protein concentrations based on RNA expression data.
## Tasks:
+ Import biological dataset and clean missing data.
+ Perform exploratory data analysis (mean, variance, histograms).
+ Create a scatter-plots of RNA vs Protein concentrations for all cell cycle phases (S, G2, G1).
+ Fit a linear regression model to predict protein levels at different cell cycle phases.
+ Identify genes related to cell cycle and ribosomes.
+ Analyze GO term frequency and correlations.

## **Lab 2: Chemical Reactions Modeling**
ðŸ“Œ **Objective**: Simulate and analyze **chemical reaction dynamics**.
### **Tasks**
+ Derive **differential equations** for a reaction system.   
+ Solve ODEs using **`scipy.integrate.odeint`**.  
+ Plot **X and Y concentration changes** over time.
+ Implement **Gillespie algorithm** for stochastic simulations.
+ Compare **ODE model vs. Gillepsie model**.
